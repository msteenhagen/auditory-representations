% \begin{abstract}That some objects are, as the naive realist has it, presented in perception does not rule out that some objects of perception are represented. I show that at least some plausible versions of naive realism to accept that audition essentially tends towards representational perception. The argument for this is that,  on the one hand, our capacity for auditory perception is for the sake of hearing the sources of sounds, while on the other those sources, if they are not sounds, cannot be constituents of auditory perception. This implies that audition essentially has a tendency to afford perception of objects that need not be constituents of experience, which in turns suggests that such perceptions defy the non-representationalist analysis offered by the naive realist and, hence, must be represented in experience.\end{abstract}

% INTRODUCTION (fold)
% Make sure this paper is maximally concrete!
\dropcap{S}{ource representationalism} is a view about auditory perception, according to which the sources of the sounds humans hear are always represented in their perceptual experience. When we listen to and hear a piano, our auditory experience may consist in a perceptual relation to its sound, it can not consist in a perceptual relation to the piano itself. In this paper I will defend source representationalism on the basis of some considerations about listening to recordings of everyday sounds. 
% INTRODUCTION (end)

% SOUND (fold)
% Introduce key example. Argue: We hear the sound of the piano when we listen to the recording. Either the same sound or a similar sound - this depends on one's view of recording and playback of sound. 
\sect Consider a situation in which you decide to listen to a stereo recording of Tatiana Nikolayeva's rendition of \emph{Die Kunst der Fuge}, a famous piano performance of J. S. Bach's baroque masterpiece that took place on a winter evening in 1953. In contrast to its original audience which found itself in the massive Building in City, you are currently seated in London, in a small and quiet room with only some books, a writing desk, and a high fidelity speaker set in your vicinity. You know that both the quality of the recording and the calibration of the loudspeakers in the room are superb, and sit back at ease, eyes closed, well aware that you're in for a treat. Carefully you press the button that will start playback. What do you hear? 

% You hear the sound of a piano
First of all, you hear the sounds of a piano. These particular sounds are perceived as soon as they fill the room when the recording starts to play back. Some will be loud, while others are muted; some may be high-pitched while others of lower audible frequencies. But is is undeniable that you can hear these sounds.   

% Introduces the hallucinatory case used later
Contrast this with the use of a device that, instead of playing back sounds, causes us to have auditory hallucinations of the sounds of a piano. A playback on such a device would result your having a series of auditory sensations, sensations a bit like tinnitus but a lot more complex, and that resemble hearing a performance of, say, Bach's \emph{Kunst der Fuge}. `Listening' to Bach's music here would not involve hearing any sound. Yet, it should be clear that ordinary experience of playing back of sound recordings does not depend on hallucinating sound. 

% Spells out qualms about reproducability: takes a neutral stance. (But keep an eye on this!) The point I need to hold on to is that we can hear the sound of a piano, and so the resemblance view must be developed as giving a gloss of that phrase as well. (Perhaps: what matters is that we hear a particular, whether abstract or concrete. The particular determines character. This particular could occur both in recording and actual cases.)
%We can use the idea of a prorietary sound here: a badly oiled revolving door may make the sound of a dying animal; sounds like a dying animal. The speaker sounds like a piano: this would not be a correct description. We do not hear the speaker.
If we say that, seated in our room, we hear the sound of a piano, what does this mean? Some have suggested that it is of the nature of sounds that they are reproducible. If they are right, then your speakers would \emph{re}produce the particular sounds that could be heard by the audience on the occasion of the actual performance as well. In other words, in hearing the tones reproduced by your loudspeakers, you may be hearing the same sounds that were produced by the piano Nikolayeva played on the evening of the concert. For whatever reason, however, some may wish to resist considering sounds to be reproducible---to be \emph{abstract} in this way. Nonetheless, even they can agree that in listening to the playback one hears some particulars sounds that, given a well-attuned stereo set, are likely to be heard as the sounds of a piano. %Needs work 

%OLD: resemble strikingly sounds that filled the concert hall on the evening of the performance. On such a picture, when we say that we hear the sounds of a piano, what we must mean is that we hear sounds that strikingly resemble the sounds of a piano.

% Argue: We can assume that we can hear the sound of a piano. We hear the piano when we listen to the recording. Two arguments: 
% [1] Generalisation argument: (softens up)
%If we can hear a piano as audience, then we we can hear a piano as listeners to recording; we can hear a piano as audience; we can hear a piano as listeners to recording. 
%[2] Phenomenological argument: (establishes)
%What will I do with the observation that we do not hear the speaker when we hear the sounds it reproduces. (We can distinguish between a speaker's producing and reproducing a sound, just as we can distinguish between someone saying something and someone rehearsing something.)

% NOTE (I need to note this: In fact I am developing three independently interesting arguments in this paper. I do think they should be developed together. First, there is the argument that we hear a piano when we listen to a recording. Second, there is the argument that this piano must be represented in experience (Local source-representationalism). Third, there is the argument that hearing all non-sound individuals must be represented in experience (Global source-representationalism). Spelling it out in terms of local and global versions helps to tie things together here.)

% SOUND (end)

%PIANO (fold)
\sect I now want to move on and argue that we hear a piano as well. The argument I will develop here is two-step. First I want to develop an argument that has convinced several authors that in ordinary auditory situation we can hear the sources of the sounds we hear. Because we can attend both to the sound and the source, we must suppose that we hear the source as well. I will use this argument to suggest that in listening to a recording, we at least hear more than the sound alone. Someone might accept this, yet suggest that what we hear besides the sound in such a case is the loudspeaker. To rule this out, I will suggest that if a speaker is broken, we can attend to the speaker and to the sound and still to something else. I contend that anyone convinces by the former argument should find this compelling reason to think we can hear more than the sound and the speaker.

% First argument
Here I should develop Nudds' claims, and so should first read his argument more carefully. I also should know what O'Callagan's stance is, and in fact look at all the other authors in that volume. I know that Elvira di Bono thinks that we should think this because of timbre.

This is how Nudds starts an unpublished piece: ``Imagine that you are woken up in the middle of the night by a strange sound. As you lie there, listening, you can attend to your experience in two ways: you might attend to the sound itself, focussing on its attributes---its pitch, timbre, and loudness---it is more likely, though, that you will attend to what is making the sound'' He uses this to make clear that we must think that we hear more than sound alone: we can attend to the thing that makes the sound. 

Imagine one is an apprentice professional tuner and has been given the job of tuning the cello of a string quartet that will be recorded for a CD release of Schubert's fourteenth string quartet. After the fact, one can surely listen to the recording and listen to the cello one has tuned. Some might just find it controversial that listening to a cello requires more than just hearing the sound of the cello.

What I should ask is whether the double attention claim presents a worry for my argument later. Why would it? This is if we assume that we can attend only to things that are present. But this is not plausible. But it would be a problem if we can attend only to things in imagination if we are committed to those things' being part of the scene. 

% Second argument
If we hear more than the sound, then why think that the piano and the loudspeaker are the only options? Let us assume that we hear a third thing. First we should say, if that third thing is not present, the argument still works. So it should be a third thing that is present. But, by hypothesis, the loudspeaker in the scenario is the only thing that actually produces sound. [We should remove the ceiling, and make it a corner or something.] Hence, an absent thing and a loudspeaker are the only options. As an absent thing we hear, a piano is the only thing consonant with the evidence we have. We can just assume the absent thing is a piano. 

%For this argument, I require the vocabulary of speakers and problems with them. I could mind some expert fora on loudspeakers. 
When one of the midrange speakers that reproduces the middle frequencies of the recorded sound has a defect, this commonly results in a change in what can be heard. What is significant it that the sound of the piano is not so much distorted---it is suddenly a sound produced by the speaker that interferes with the sound of the piano. This is important. There is the production reproduction opposition here. And there is the fact that there are two sounds with audibly different sources. 

When we listen to a recording of a piece of music on a speaker set with a broken loudspeaker, we can suddenly start hearing the speaker. Speakers only function well if they are unheard. (There is a parallel with trope l'oeuil here, so be careful! Or, perhaps I can use this?) 

A loudspeaker is more like a picture's canvas than it is like a picture's paint. The sound the speaker produces is more like the paint that sits on the canvas. Both the speaker and the canvas are normally unseen. Some pictures are damaged, so that the canvas becomes visible, but this is disruptive. Similarly, when we hear the loudspeaker when we listen to a recording, this is disruptive. 

%PIANO (end)

% REPRESENTATION (fold)
% Argue: If we hear the piano when we listen to the recording, then we perceive a piano that is not present to us. If we perceive something not present to us, the thing is represented in experience. If we hear the piano when we listen to the recording, then the piano is represented in experience when we listen to the recording. We hear the piano when we listen to the recording. The piano is represented in experience when we listen to the recording.
\sect Perceptual representation may be understood through a sufficient condition. If a perceiver perceives some object that is not present to the senses, then the object is represented in perception. Hence, we have a grasp on the phenomenon of perceptual representation, because we are at least able to identify some paradigmatic situations in which the phenomenon occurs. For present purposes, it is enough to think of such occurrences as being facilitated by a capacity we have for representing objects or properties in experience. 

Given this understanding of perceptual representation, we may say that our hearing a piano when we are listening to the recording counts as an instance of it. A piano is represented in our perception of our surroundings. Hence, we can conclude that at least a weak version of source-representationalism is correct: whenever we hear objects `in' or `through' hearing the sounds played back from a recording those objects are merely represented in experience. 

Some may be interested in enquiring into an explanation of this phenomenon. How is perceptual representation of this kind possible? Pointing to a manifestation of a representational capacity we have may not be entirely satisfactory. Perhaps, however, we should take seriously that the sound we hear plays an essential role in the exercise of that capacity. It may be that it is first and foremost that it is the sound we hear that represents a piano to us. If that is right, then we can further enquire what it is about that sound, as an object that is arguably just present in our experience, that makes it a candidate representation? 

At this point I do not want to move in this direction. Instead, I want to rehearse that we have seen that a local version of source-representationalism is vindicated, and in the next section argue that we in fact have reason to think that source-representationalism should be understood as a stronger, global thesis about our perception of the sources of sounds. 

% REPRESENTATION (end)

% GENERALISE (fold)
% Argue: If the piano is represented in experience when we listen to the recording, then the piano is represented in experience when we listen to it as an audience. [[WORK: This is because these experiences are subjectively indistinguishable, and belong to the same perceptual kind. ]]
\sect So far we have seen that in hearing a playback of a recording we can hear both the sound of the recorded instrument and the instrument itself. We also reached the conclusions that, although the sound may simply be present to the mind, the instrument must be represented if we hear it when we listen to a recording of its sound, given that this instrument is absent from the perceptual situation. However, these conclusions have been established in a discussion about hearing playbacks of recorded sounds. Can we generalise these findings to cases where an instrument is actually played to us? 

One thing we must see here is that listening to an instrument via a recording, and listen to it being played in real life may be indistinguishable for us. Think of those talented musicians in the bowels of London's Underground about which, at some distance, one is in doubt if they are actually playing their guitar, or just playing a recording of a guitar. More generally, we could  


It should be clear that, if the answer to this question were `no', then the actual presence the instrument makes onto the perceptual scene would make a difference to the kind of auditory experience we have. In other words, if only listening to recordings of a piano would be representational, then whether our hearing a piano is representational depends constitutively on whether a piano is present in the perceptual situation.




Earlier we conceived of a device that would generate auditory hallucinations of hearing a piano. When we have an auditory hallucination, we are in a state we could characterise as being similar to hearing a piano, without its being a hearing of a piano. There is another case which is comparable. We can imagine hearing a piano, and in doing so are in a state that may be characterised as like hearing a piano without its being a piano. A difference between the hallucination and the imagination, however, is that it is always obvious to us that our imagining hearing a piano is not actually a hearing of a piano. 

``Having the visual experience of water puts one in a position which is not neutral with respect to the actual environment as to whether blue water is present or not: that is how we have to characterise what our visual experience is like. Visualising the water puts you in a position of not being neutral with respect to the imagined situation. In visualising the expanse of water, one is not non-committal whether the imagined situation contains a blue expanse of water.'' (414)

``Having the visual experience of water puts one in a position which is not neutral with respect to the actual environment as to whether blue water is present or not: that is how we have to characterise what our visual experience is like. ''

As Martin explains ``Visualising the water puts you in a position of not being neutral with respect to the imagined situation. In visualising the expanse of water, one is not non-committal whether the imagined situation contains a blue expanse of water.'' (414)

In imagining hearing a piano, one equally is not entirely non-committal about what is contained in the imagined situation. One will take the situation to be one which contains the sound of a piano. However, in imagining hearing a piano one is non-committal whether the situation contains a piano or not. An explanation for this is that, as we saw, it is possible to hear a piano in situations that do not themselves contain a piano. What we can conclude from this is that the experience of hearing a piano, though constitutively dependent on the presence of the sound of a piano, is not constitutively dependent on the presence of a piano. 

(As the ancients saw well, the phenomenology of hearing voices is different. I am open to the suggestion that in imagining hearing Tom's voice we are committed to the imagined situation's containing Tom. That is why source-representationalism is a thesis about the sources of sounds, and not about the `sources of voices'. I am thankful to Margaret Hampson for discussion of this point.)

We can give another rationale for the lack of dependence on the presence of the piano. Martin explains that ``When one visualises an ocean like the Pacific, one imagines a blue expanse. Reflecting on what one’s act of visualising is like, one can attend only to the blue expanse that one visualises and nothing else. No surrogate or medium for the water or for the blue are evident to one in so imagining.''(413) But as we saw, in hearing a piano one can always attend to the sound of the piano as well. This suggests that the sound may function as a `surrogate' of `mediator' for the piano. It is not obvious that such an aural mediator is always evident to one, but as we saw it is always a possible object for attention. 


In this section I generalise the previous observation to all cases of sources representationalism. This turns the previous conclusion that some source hearing is representational into a stronger thesis: all source hearing is representational. I want to make use of a modified version of the argument from hallucination. 



My main move here will be to demonstrate that whether we hear the source or not does not constitutively depend on whether the source is present in the perceptual situation. That is, whether we hear a piano does not depend on whether a piano is present. We can proceed here by considering the case where we imagine hearing a piano. If imagine hearing a piano commits us to imagining a piano, then wether we imagine hearing a piano depends on whether we imagine a piano. If imagining O commits us to imagining P, then O constitutively depends on P. 




When we imagine seeing a piano, we are not taking there to be a piano before us, but we are non-neutral towards the scene we imagine: it contains a piano. 
When we imagine hearing a piano, we are not taking there to be a piano before us, but the non-neutrality of the scene is interesting: it contains the sound of a piano. 

I need to make it extremely obvious that in imagining hearing a piano all we do is imagine hearing the sound of a piano. What follows from this is that the experience of hearing a piano is neutral about the presence or absence of a piano. Hence, if the experience occurs as a representational experience in the absence of a piano, then if the experience occurs in the instrument’s presence it is representational as well. 



A. We could not have the fundamental kind of experience we have in R and C if the sound was not present in the perceptual situation. Hence, whether we have the fundamental kind of experience we have in R and C constitutively depends on whether the sound is present in the perceptual situation. In other words, what it is to have an experience of that kind in part depends on that particular sound's presence. [Point where the abstract/concrete issue becomes relevant.]

The representationalist about sound perception can deny this by making an assumption. We can have an experience of the same fundamental kind irrespective of the presence of the sound. 

B. 



In its canonical formulations, the argument from hallucination relies on a common kind assumption. This assumption requires that a hallucination and a veridical perception of a tree both have an experience of a tree as a common kind. Given that, whenever we are veridically perceiving a tree, we have an experience of the same kind as when we are hallucinating a tree,

Martin writes: ``As presented above, both sense-datum views and intentionalism assume that perceptual experiences form a common kind of mental state among cases of veridical perception, illusion and hallucination. The perceptual experience which one has when seeing a pig is of a kind which could have occurred were one not perceiving at all but having a visual hallucination indistinguishable from the sighting of the pig. On such an assumption, one may demand that whatever account one is to give of the experience one has when one veridically perceives, the same account must be applicable in some cases of hallucination.''

We can assume that we are perceiving in both C and R, that we are hearing the same (kind) of sound in C and R, and that we are hearing the same kind of instrument in C and R. We have established that in R the instrument is represented in experience. What reason would we have to think C is different, such that the instrument is not represented. The only difference to the case is the actual presence of the piano being played: does this make a significant difference to the phenomenology of experience? That is the question. If the answer is yes, we have reason to deny the common kind assumption for these cases. If the answer is no, we have reason to hold on to that assumption. 

Let us consider the visual case: here we have a similar situation. Do we have reason to think that the presence of objects makes a difference? The concern here is often explicated in terms of transparency. When we introspect in perception, we find the present objects we perceive. If we would not be perceiving, we would not be able to find those objects.

There are two discussions: SD on the one and NR and REP on the other; NR on the one and REP on the other. Which one am I interested in and why? 

%This is an argument! I can develop this on the back of Mike's 2002 argument. 
If we want to imagine hearing a piano, we imagine simply hearing the sound of a piano. This indicates that our experience is neutral to the presence or absence of the piano. 




Recording: one sits in a room, and the neighbours play a recording of Chopin's piano sonatas. Concert: one sites in a room, and the neighbours play Chopin's piano sonatas on their piano. Let us assume that in both R and C one hears the sound of a piano that comes through one's ceiling. Let us assume that in both R and C one hears a piano. And let us assume that R and C are subjectively indistinguishable. Someone might be in one of both without having any experiential grounds to rule out she is in either R or C. 

(What the room scenario does is remove the need to imagine no input from other sense modalities, which is not obviously possible.)

We assumed that hearing the sound of a piano and hearing a piano is present both in R and C: auditorily, that is their common factor. We can assume that in both cases one is perceptually related to a sound. The perceptual experience which one has in C is of a kind which occurs in R: one is veridically perceiving the sound of a piano. 

We can move by reductio. Given these assumptions, and given the assumption that in C a piano is present and in R a piano is absent, Does one's being in the kind of experiential state one is in depend constitutively on whether there is a piano upstairs or not? 
Compare: does it so depend on whether there is a sound of a piano or not? Yes, one could argue: compare the hallucination machine described earlier: one would not be hearing anything if that machine was active, even if the cases were subjectively indistinguishable. 
Reductio: given that it does so depend, the presence or absence of the piano must make a difference to the kind of state you are in. One could say that in C a piano is present and in R it is absent in experience. [[Getting close, but still not there!]]

Let me repeat what we have:
1. R and C are indistinguishable
2. R and C both involve hearing the sound of a piano
3. R and C both involve hearing a piano
4. R and C both involve the presence of the sound of a piano
5. C involves the presence of a piano
5. R does not involve the presence of a piano
Why would we say that the presence of the piano does not make any difference to your experience in C? I like Williamson's way of approa


This is a common formulation of the argument from hallucination (I follow Crane here): 

FIRST: It seems possible for someone to have an experience—a hallucination—which is subjectively indistinguishable from a genuine perception but where there is no mind-independent object being perceived.

This premise can be reformulated to be about the piano. It is possible for someone to have an experience which is subjectively indistinguishable from listening to a piano that is presently played in one's vicinity. 

SECOND: The perception and the subjectively indistinguishable hallucination are experiences of essentially the same kind.

This premise can be reformulated as a claim about the experience of the person listening to a recording on the one hand, and the experience of the person listening to the piano actually being played on the other. The claim would be that these are experiences of essentially the same kind. There will be controversy here about how to understand `essentially'. Perhaps I should rephrase this in terms of `fundamentally' and stick to Martin's formulation, as my argument is in part addressed to him (though only obliquely).

THIRD: Therefore it cannot be that the essence of the perception depends on the objects being experienced, since essentially the same kind of experience can occur in the absence of the objects.

Here we need to do a lot of interpretation. The reformulation needs to be that it cannot be that the essence of the experience of a member of the audience depends on the piano's being present, since essentially the same kind of experience can occur in the absence of the piano. Again, the issue will be about spelling out what we mean by `same kind' here.

CONCLUSION: Therefore the ordinary conception of perceptual experience—which treats experience as dependent on the mind-independent objects around us—cannot be correct.

I want to reach a different conclusion of course. I want to argue that the ordinary perceptual experience of hearing a piano does not depend on the presence of the piano (but only on the presence of a sound of a piano). 

It will take me too long to comment on the argument from hallucination in such detail, and so I should first run my own version and only afterwards mention that it in fact is an application of the argument from hallucination. This will be fairly obvious anyway.

There is something funny going on, and I want to pause and describe this. We can make two moves: 
When we hear a sound and its source, then an experience of that kind will be subjectively indistinguishable from hearing  a recording of that sound. 
When we hear a sound and its source, then an experience of that kind will be subjectively indistinguishable from hearing a the source actually produce the sound.
I recall from discussions with Roberta that there is an asymmetry that the naive realist exploits in resisting the argument from hallucination. This has something to do with phenomenal character. That might be a way in to make the argument work for source representationalism. 

Someone who disagrees with me on this point, what will they think? They will agree that hearing the piano when we listen to a recording is representational. But they will claim that when the piano is played to us actually, we will be able to hear the piano in a non-representational way. So, by hypothesis the piano is present and we hear the same (or a similar) sound. The question is, does this add something to the phenomenology of the experience? 

Reflect on the classical argument again. Here, the hallucination and the perception are said to have the same phenomenology. Yet, this is only true if we assume that there is a common element involved in both. Yet, someone might deny that there is a common element involved, because someone may deny that there is anything we become aware of in a hallucination. A hallucination may be defined just as an experience that is subjectively indistinguishable from a veridical perception. 

The sound case is interesting, because there we have a common element of more or less the kind the sense datum theorist at least dreamt of. Should this be my main focus? Should I claim that the `common kind' assumption must be made for the comparison I am interested in? This leads to three questions. 

1. Can sounds be a common factor of the relevant sort?
2. Does assuming the common factor claim validate the argument from hallucination? 
3. Does assuming the common factor claim validate the argument for source representationalism? 

% GENERALISE (end)

% EVALUATE (fold)
% The experience of tinnitus does not similarly move us to accept that hearing sounds is representational. But we have seen that we should accept source representationalism: that hearing sources of sounds is representational. 
\sect

For perception to be representational, we earlier noted that it is sufficient if we have an object of perception that is absent from the perceptual scene. Now we see that this is not a necessary condition. Often the objects we hear are present to us, for instance because we see them (assuming naive realism). What is necessary for an aspect of experience to be representational is that the object could be absent. This entails that some object can both be presented and represented in experience. This is interesting to develop.

Emphasise that this argument has no force in the debate between naive realists and representationalists about experience. I find it plausible to think that sounds are not represented in experience, but someone might wish to try to defend the thesis that they are, because perceptual experience as such is representational. If such an argument would succeed, then source representationalism is still true---though I wonder whether the representationalist will use `representation' in exactly the sense we have seen sources are represented in experience. 

For further research, It is a good question how we should approach the hallucinatory case. If we have a hallucination of hearing a piano, should we still say that a piano is represented in experience, or should we say that we have a hallucination of a piano's being represented in experience?
