Thanks to sound hearing things is possible. Source representationalism, as I will call it, is a specific view about what hearing things consists in. It says that sounds can act as perceptual representations. More specifically, it says that sources of sounds can be represented in perceptual experience by the sounds that reach our ears. This makes the view a distinct form of representationalism about perception. In this paper I show why we should accept it, and will identify what may move some to take the source representationalist claim to embody a general insight about our auditory perception of the world.  

# Sounds and sources

I will suppose that we can hear both sounds and their sources. What do I mean by sound sources? Some material objects or bodies produce sounds when someone or something plays, hits, or otherwise moves them. When they do so these bodies become a source of sound. It is in them and in their activity that sound originates. Take an example. On the 24th of January 24, 1975, Keith Jarrett gave a solo piano concert in Cologne. Jarrett played that night on a badly tuned Bösendorfer piano. The instrument Jarrett played on that occasion was the origin of the sounds that made up his improvised composition. That night, then, that Bösendorfer baby grand was one of the sound sources in the concert venue. 

Sources of sounds come in many kinds. But philosophers today writing on perception typically accept that at least some of the sources of sounds are themselves audible. Just as we can see a magpie, or taste vinegar in our salad, we can hear things such as people in the corridor, aeroplanes overhead, and a pub fight down the street. We can hear their sounds as well, of course. But I will suppose we lack a sound reason to adopt the restrictive view, commonly attributed to Berkeley's mouthpiece Philonous in the _Three Dialogues_, that sounds are all we ever hear [see @kalderon2015ac for a useful inventory of the different positions in this area].

That we can hear a piano may seem obvious, but how is it possible? Consider, only the sound that reaches us has the audible qualities of pitch and loudness our ears are sensitive to, not the piano itself. The source representationalist maintains that sources of sounds can become audible when they are represented in our perceptual experience. More specifically, they claim that audible sounds in our environment can make material objects or bodies audible, sounds produced at some point in time and now reaching our ears. According to the source representationalist, those sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception. That, according to them, is at least a perfectly good way we can hear sources.

# Situating the view

Before making a case for source representationalism, let me situate the view in the larger debate about the nature of perception. This is helpful, as it brings out why what follows should be of interest to philosophers of perception.

On the face of it, the claim that perception can be representational seems mainstream. Yet, the specific way in which the source representationalist advances this claim is interesting for at least two reasons. First, many philosophers nowadays defend or assume a universal thesis, that all perception of objects is representational. When philosophers hear 'representationalism', they typically think of the view that all forms of perception are representational, all of the time. Implicit in this is that representationalism about perception is an all or nothing affair: either all of perception is representational, or none of it is. The source representationalist claim brings out why this is a misleading way of conceiving of the situation. They make only a weaker claim about perceptual representation, and do so coherently (as I will show below). Sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception, they say. They assert no more than that, potentially, there are circumstances in which perception is representational. In this way, the source representationalist thesis disrupts a tidy way of outlining the shape of the debate about the nature of perception. The logical availability of the view proves how one can coherently maintain that merely some perception is representational. This makes the position worth considering.

There is another reason why source representationalism should be of interest to those thinking about perception. It has a story about what perceptual representation is, or at least about what form it can take. At this point they do not just break lines with the mainstream, but move well beyond it. Many authors have objected to standard representationalist theories of perception that they remain largely silent on what perceptual representations are. Many authors assume that perception is representational, yet never elucidate what such representation consists in, or what does the representing [see @travis2004aa for a canonical statement of this criticism]. The source representationalist advances a representationalism that embodies an answer to the question what perceptual representations are. If we may believe the source representationalist, sounds are a paradigm example of such representations. It is the sound of the piano played by Jarrett that enabled the Cologne audience to hear the instrument back in 1975. Sounds confer audibility on their sources. And the source representationalist claims that the perceptual function sounds fulfil is representational. What makes it representational? As I will spell out in more detail below, sounds can make sources audible in a manner that does not depend on the presence of those sources to the perceiver. In this way, the source representationalist offers us an informative and productive model of thinking about perceptual representation more generally.

If the source representationalist is right, then sounds, given the way they can function in perception, are perceptual representations, at least potentially. This is a controversial claim, no doubt. But I want to explain why the source representationalist claim is attractive and hard to resist.

# Playing back recorded sounds

Many people will have in their possession the album of Jarrett's performance, published as _The Köln Concert_. The recording enables the reproduction of sounds that an ECM Records engineer captured back in 1975 using a pair of condenser microphones and a portable tape machine. To defend the source-representationalist claim, we only need to reflect on what we can hear when we listen to the playback of a sound recording like this. What is interesting about recordings is that they allow sounds that occurred on an earlier occasion to occur once more.

So what does playing back this recording enable you to hear? Beyond question, it seems to me, is that you can hear the sound of a piano. This particular sound becomes audible as soon as it fills the room when playback starts. It may subtly decompose into individual sounds of piano keys pressed by Jarrett's hands. But these individual sounds too are instances of the sound of a piano.

Despite the fact that there is no piano around, the sound of such an instrument is genuinely there in your room. Somewhat frivolously, we may contrast listening to an ordinary sound recording with a situation in which a device is used that causes us to have auditory hallucinations. The latter device would have caused you to have an hallucinatory episode that could in some subjectively salient respects have resembled listening to Jarrett's solo improvisations, but would have been very different. Not only would there have been no actual piano, there would have be no sound of a piano either. As we could put it, it would at best merely seem to you that you're hearing the sound of a piano, a bit like people suffering from tinnitus seem to hear a buzz or tone. Enjoying a piano recording by means of such an hallucination-provoking device would not involve hearing the sound of a piano. 

Why is this contrast relevant? People who enjoy a recording of Jarrett's concert are typically not hallucinating. If you listen to the album, your perception not merely resembles hearing the sounds of a piano trickling into the room; hearing those sounds is exactly what's going on. The contrast brings out that in listening to a recording, something that the audience heard back in 1974 is part of your current perceptual situation: the sound of a piano. That sound is a 'common factor' present both in listening to Jarrett's improvisations in real life, and in listening to them via a recording. In the hallucination case, it is not obvious that such a common factor would be present. The presence of this common factor motivates the idea that recordings allow sounds that occurred on an earlier occasion to occur once more. The sounds of a piano that were produced in 1974 re-occur each time we play back the recording. 

# Using sounds for listening to sources

Imagine that at night you are woken up by a series of sounds coming from your living room. Reluctant to get out of bed, you listen more carefully to what goes on. Was a window left open, allowing the wind to come in? Is someone down there? Suddenly you hear a set of nailed feet sliding over the wooden floor. You realise it's the cat. The animal must have managed to open the kitchen door again. What is it doing? Again, you listen more carefully, and are able to hear the cat playing with a small object. 

It is interesting that just by knowing what you're listening to, you are able to attend more determinately to what you hear, and as a result come to hear more, resulting in a better grasp on the situation.This is a clear instance of how knowledge can make you more sensitive to a perceptible environment, thereby enabling you to acquire new knowledge. On the basis of the various recognisable sounds that reach you upstairs, such as a rustle of newspapers, the clattering of some pens falling on the floor, you're able to hear nails, footsteps, a cat, and eventually are able quite reliably to track an animal through the downstairs room. Your perceptual attention, though utterly dependent on the sounds that reach you, doesn't principally go out for those sounds. Perhaps they grab your attention for a brief moment, but you don't pay much heed to them. Instead, you're listening to the cat, and to what _it_ is doing.

Situations like this bring out that we can successfully attend and hence listen both to sounds and what a sound is of [cf. @gaver1993aa; @nudds2014aa]. You started out by hearing just some noises from downstairs, yet ended up listening attentively to a cat engaged in night time play. This describes a shift from attention to sounds themselves to attention to the sources of those sounds, a shift that can become obvious when we reflect on what it is like to have such experience.  The experience of hearing in part has the character it has because we are able to listen to sources as well as sounds. We are so happy to count the kind of experience described above as one of _hearing a cat_ at least in part because the specific determination of the attention that in part constitutes what it is like to perceive things in this way is manifest in experience.

The observation that we can successfully attend and hence listen what a sound is of generalises over both cases of actual listening and cases in which we listen to recorded sounds. This has a straightforward explanation. In both cases we simply use sounds that reach our ears to listen to something beyond them. 

Real-life examples clearly support this generalisation. To find out what had happened in the Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh on 8 September 1994, a team of audio forensic investigators played back the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved after the accident. The team was particularly interested in a malfunctioning of the plane's rudders. Hence, it is unlikely that they listened merely to the sounds reproduced by their playback equipment. Indeed, they found out that the rudder's eventual jamming was not due to inept operation of controls, but occurred because of mechanical obstruction. Their observation required a careful, well-informed 'mining' of an auditory scene that was made audible again by replaying the recording. This activity of listening crucially relies on an ability to attend to specific objects and properties that are made audible through a recording. The investigators' finding was made possible because they were able to single out specific items audible via the recorded sound: the plane's rudder, as it locked in its extreme position, and the members of the flight crew as they manipulated the controls.

Although they exercised their capacity to hear parts of a passenger jet with expert precision, the forensic team did not engage in anything that's beyond the pale of ordinary auditory perception or discrimination. In listening to a recording it is possible to focus one's attention on something that goes beyond the heard sound itself [see @siegel2014aa for a discussion of the listening culture of these forensic contexts]. If this is correct, then whether one can engage in this mode of attentive listening to sound sources just does not depend on whether one listens to a recording or not. Whether it is a recording or not is simply irrelevant. Instead, the audibility of some concrete individual importantly depends on whether or not one hears the right sounds.

# Not epistemic hearing

In listening to a recording we can listen to and hence hear a sound's source. I want to emphasise that I am talking about perceiving particulars. Hearing a cat is not just a kind of 'epistemic' hearing or 'hearing that\lips'. Such epistemic hearing---coming to learn about facts through hearing---does no doubt occur. Yet we can hear more than just _that_ a sound is of a cat, or _that_ the cat is in the room. The present point concerns perception of a cat, a form of perception that is arguably more fundamental. I think we may suppose that quite generally we can only hear _that_ such-and-such is the case by hearing some particular thing or other. What the above discussion suggests is that hearing _that_ the cat broke the vase is possibly rooted in an experience of hearing particulars that are not themselves sounds: the knowledge you come to have seems explained by your hearing the cat, your hearing its running through the room, and your hearing the vase when it lands and shatters into fragments on the wooden floor.

# Sounds as perceptual representations

Let me sum up what I have shown so far. By playing back a sound recording at a certain point in time a sound produced earlier in time becomes audible once more. It does so by being reproduced. This means that the sounds that were recorded in the past occur again in the present. Such a sound may enable us to hear the original sound source, given that it enables us successfully to listen to that source via the played back sounds.

It should be clear that the original source need not be actually there when we play back the recording. The example of Keith Jarrett’s recording, or of the flight recorder, are instances of a phenomenon that by now is completely familiar to us. The technology for playing back recorded sounds has only become available after Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, and later Thomas Edison, conducted their pioneering work on sound recording and reproduction. The late nineteenth century invention of phonograph cylinders first enabled sounds produced at a specific moment in history to be captured, stored, and played back at a later time [cf. @sterne2003aa]. Scott de Martinville's rendition of the French song "Au Clair de la Lune", recorded on 9 April 1860, is said to be the earliest sound sequence in history that was recorded and can be replayed (though at the time of recording it was not yet possible to play back the song). 

Thanks to the efforts of these early pioneers, we are now able to hear things that are physically absent from our current perceptual situation, and in fact do so on a regular basis. The malfunctioning aeroplane parts and crew members were audible months after the craft had crashed. They were audible despite their absence from the perceptual situation. A similar point can be made about the way the recording of the _Köln Concert_ makes a Bösendorfer baby grand audible. This implies that successfully listening to an object does not always require that object to be present in a perceptual situation. What reflection on sound recordings brings out that, for a source to become perceptible, all that needs to be present is the right sound.

Why would such perception be representational? It is typically assumed that the representational dimension of perception reveals itself in cases where, allegedly, things sensorily appear to a perceiver that are not present to the senses, or where we have reason to think that the perceptual state a perceiver is in does not depend on such presence [@rowlands2015aa, p. 6; siegel2010aa, ch. 6]. Wherever a kind of perception does not require some or all of its objects to be present to the senses, we may take it to involve a form of representation of those objects. Something is represented in someone's perception where their perceptual state does not depend on such presence. 

Isn't that precisely the perceptual situation we may find ourselves in when we listen to a sound source via a recording? I think it is. But to show this I need to address a difficult question. What is meant by 'being present' here? 

The question is difficult, because it is at least natural to think that as soon as something is perceived, it is thereby at least in some sense 'present' to us. Was their hearing the rudder not sufficient ground for thinking that, even after the plane had crashed, the rudder was present to the audio forensic investigators? The point is well taken. Just as there is undeniably a sense in which that rudder was not present to them, there is at least a sense in which, by means of those sounds, it did become present. This tension is no more than a consequence of the somewhat see-saw way philosophers have conceived of perceptual representation. It seems to have worked its way into the very catchphrase they have come to use to capture the resulting mode of perception: _presence in absence_.

It may be thought that the piano is not present in, and hence absent from the experience, because the event of the piano's being played is in the past. But this does not seem quite right. The fact that something existed only in the past does not by itself exclude it from a current perceptual situation. Think of the visual perception of distant stars. The star Nova Delphinus exploded and vanished more than 10.000 years ago, yet its explosion was clearly visible from Earth during a 27-day period in 2013. Astronomers published the fact widely, as the explosion could be seen by the naked eye, and the event drew great public interest. Was the perception of those who saw the explosion representational? That is not _obvious_. The star, though in the past, needed to be present in order to sustain the visibility those people were drawn by. 

If there were no significant differences between our perception of Jarrett's piano when we listen to a playback of the recording and our perception of the distant star, then we should conclude that listening to a piano via a recording is not representational at all, or at least not obviously so. Gideon Rosen brought out to me how attractive this conclusion may seem at first blush. But it is mistake. It is a mistake because there clearly is a significant difference. The significant difference between our perception of Jarrett's piano when we listen to a playback of the recording and our perception of the distant star lies in the fact that the audibility of the piano in the situation we're considering depends on a revival of something from an earlier situation, whereas our perception of the star does not depend on such a revival [@martin2012aa picks up on this as well].

The point is this. Playing back a recording doesn't continue a sound, and so doesn't extend what is there for us to perceive back to a time before we pressed play. 

Let me explain this. It is because the light and the vast distance it bridged extends the initial conditions of visibility for that star well into the future. In the auditory case, the initial conditions of audibility are likely to have ceased to be: the sounds may have died out at the end of the concert, and things may have gone silent. When we play back the recording we revive the sounds by allowing them to live once more---we do not _lengthen_ their lives, but start them over again. (To use a spiritual image, light can make a star visually immortal, whereas recording techniques allow sounds to be reincarnated.) Playback repeats or re-enacts a sound. And although such recreation requires us to reproduce the original sound, it does not require us to reproduce the original source. That _is_ obvious. It is in this sense that we are able to hear the piano in its absence: in order to make that piano audible once more, sounds need to be presented to us, but the piano itself can remain absent [some philosophers have observed this point, see e.g. @gregory2013aa, p. 17]<!-- check ref -->. It is in this sense that our perceptual state does not depend on the presence of the piano.

When we listen to a sound source via a recording our perceptual state does not depend on the presence of the source we hear. That source is to that extent represented. We now see why the parallel with the star case was misplaced. Even though the two cases have in common that what we can hear existed in the past, they differ in that in the star case the past object must be still visible, whereas in the recording case the past object need not be still audible. What matters is that it is audible once more. Perhaps a better parallel would be between being now faced with a photograph of Nova Delphinus, a star no longer visible in the sky (at least not from Earth). Just as the sound, it seems, the photograph represents the star in perception, and puts us in a position to look at it once more, despite the fact that the star is now absent from our perceptual situation.

# Sounds as repeatables

The case for source representationalism I want to make turns on the idea that playing back a sound recording reproduces part of the perceptual conditions of an earlier situation. I think it's clear that playing back a recording of a piano concert enables us to hear the piano that was played as well. But consider what we need to do to make that happen? All that is needed is the reproduction of the original sounds. There's no need to bring along the piano itself. 

To avoid misunderstanding, I am not assuming that we need to re-introduce the very sounds produced on that evening in 1974. Some have argued that it is of the nature of sounds that they are reproducible entities (cf. @martin2012aa, the point finds confirmation in Jonathan Sterne's -@sterne2003aa history of sound reproduction and its reception). Something is reproducible only if can 'recur' in history. It counts as an abstract entity because of that. Think of a photographic image, recorded by a camera at a specific moment in history, but that allows for multiple instances to be mass-distributed in news papers and on web logs. If sounds are reproducible like that, then we may suppose that your speakers reproduce the particular sounds that were produced by a Bösendorfer piano in January 1975. 

I think this is a plausible conception of sound reproduction, but the source representationalist can do without. Some may want to resist attributing to sounds an inherently reproducible and to that extent abstract nature. They will think that, at least in that respect, sounds are more like people: just as it is impossible for the same person to live twice, it is impossible for a sound to sound in history twice. The sounds your speakers currently broadcast originate just there, in the corner of your room, produced by the coppery coils of your tweeters and woofers. These sounds bear no intrinsic relation to sounds that died against the walls of the opera building in Cologne in 1975, though there may be a causal relation: the sounds sound the way they do because the original sounds sounded the way they did. Unless it has lasted for over thirty-five years (for an example of such old sounds, think of the sound of the Niagara Falls), a sound heard in 1975 and a sound heard in 2014 must be ontologically distinct, or so the thought runs. In light of our actual recording practices, I do not think this rather unimaginative view has much to recommend to it. But even on such an austere conception of the metaphysics of sound, a well-calibrated stereo set can broadcast sounds exactly like the sounds that Jarrett's off-key piano produced in 1975. This is just the auditory analogue of the possibility that someone gives birth to a _Doppelganger_ of, say, Napoleon. They would give birth not the same individual, but to someone who on many occasions can pass itself off for it. Once this is accepted, then it should be granted that playing back a recording may at least allow you to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original, recorded sounds. This is an idealization, of course. But it's crucial to see that if we assume that sounds are not inherently reproducible, this ideal must be regarded as somehow regulative in the practice of sound recording: to play a recording is to produce sounds that, ideally, have all the relevant audible characteristic in common with the sounds that were recorded. And so even in this qualified sense, what your speakers broadcast may be thought of as sounds of a piano: they are sounds that have the typical audible characteristics of sounds pianos produce.

This provides us with a preliminary characterisation of the situation. What matters is that in listening to a recording of Jarrett's piano concert you find yourself in a very similar auditory situation as the original audience back in 1975. Your stereo-set allows you to recreate part of the perceptual conditions of an earlier situation, if not by reintroducing the very sounds produced on that Cologne concert stage, then at least by surrounding you with sounds that have the relevant audible characteristics in common with those original sounds.

# Subconclusion

We have now established the main claim of the source representationalist: sounds can represent (perceptually represent) material objects or bodies in perception. We can hear both the sound of a piano and a piano itself in listening to a recording of Jarrett's Köln Concert.

The current proposal allows for a defence of a local form of representationalism about perception that can be accepted by philosophers of many stripes. Assuming that there is nothing peculiar about pianos, we may conclude that whenever we hear a source merely in hearing the sounds played back from a recording, the source is represented in experience; this is because in such a situation its audibility does not depend on the presence of the piano. Before exploring how far-reaching this claim is, I want to say more about what makes perceptual representation of this form possible.

# The possibility of representation
 
Sources can be represented in perception in the way the source representationalist maintains. This raises the question by what mechanism perceptual representation of this kind is possible. Merely suggesting that we possess a capacity for representational perception may not be entirely satisfactory. But we have already enough on the table to say more. The sound we can hear plays a determining role in the exercise of this capacity [this is not infrequently overlooked, see e.g. @tolliver2007aa, p. 143]. 

Just as other perceptual capacities, the capacity for representational perception is only exercised in response to something. We may think of it as a _reactive_ capacity [cf.@kalderon2015aa]. On the source representationalist picture, sound figures as an essential cog in the machinery of representation in auditory perception. In general, what we can hear is at least in part determined by the audible character of the sounds we perceive. And if the sound reproduced by these speakers did not have audible characteristics of the right kind, then hearing that sound would not enable us to hear a piano at all. We heard a piano because we heard sounds with the right characteristics. 

This suggests that it is the heard sound that represents a piano to us. Sounds are representations, at least potentially. Naturally, this leads us to ask what it is about that sound, as an object of audition, or of our perception of such sounds, that lets it take on such a representative attire. Here I will not address this question. As such, source representationalism leaves open what shape such answers or explanations take. If the previous discussion is along the right lines, then whatever account we give of the characteristics of sounds, or of perceptual representations more generally, we do possess a psychological capacity to make use of them. Hearing sounds with the right character puts one in a position to exercise this capacity.

# Representationalisms

I want to emphasise again that this understanding of perceptual representation should be contrasted with an understanding of representation that often holds afloat 'representationalism' or 'intentionalism' about perception. Numerous philosophers in recent years have assumed that perception as such is intentional or representational. What they mean is that representation constitutes part or even all of what it is to perceive. As Crane writes, 

> the intentionalist theory of perception denies that the essential phenomenal character of a perceptual experience is essentially determined (wholly or partly) by the real objects which are perceived. This is because it holds that perception and hallucination are states with the same phenomenal character and therefore of the same mental kind; but in the case of hallucination there is no real object being perceived. [@crane2011aa]

The core claim Crane attributes to the intentionalist about perception is that the actual objects present in our environment do not essentially determine the character of the perceptual experience we have. In this way he agrees that the mark of representation is its independence of the presence of any 'real object'. But crucially, the source representationalist, at least as I have characterised their view, remains neutral about whether perception as such is so dependent. That is, they need not deny that actual objects present in our environment at least in part determine the character of the perceptual experience we have. More specifically, they need not deny that the character of hearing an old car drive by is determined (wholly or partly) by the roaring sounds that are actually present in our environment, and affect our eardrums. To my mind, that those sounds determine the character of the experience of hearing an old car seems attractive. Such dependence could help us distinguish, at least conceptually, between the recording cases and the hallucination example I discussed above. It is a virtue of the source representationalist position that it can embrace this attractive understanding of what it is to perceive, while still being able to identify with some precision under what conditions perception becomes representational.

# Illusion in sound perception

At this point, someone could object that the case of hearing a cat at night and hearing the recording of a plane's rudder are different. Where in the former case there actually is a cat producing those sounds, in the latter a loudspeaker is directly responsible for the audible sound. Hence, the objection would run, the fact that one can attend to something beyond the mere sound of a recording just suggests that we can hear the loudspeaker that reproduces it.

This objection is unconvincing. As every audiophile will attest, loudspeakers are inaudible if they function well. Imagine that, while listening to the recording of Jarrett's play, an annoying tearing noise makes itself heard. Your loudspeaker is bust, and its sound now interferes with the piano's melodies; such a tearing will stand out in experience as not belonging to the recording itself. This is what hearing a loudspeaker is like. Understanding what it would be to hear a loudspeaker requires consideration of cases where the device has a noticeable defect. It should be clear that, instead of setting a standard for listening to recorded sounds, hearing a speaker just signals that your equipment needs to be replaced. <!-- NOTES: The point is worth defending more. We can hear loudspeakers, but we do so in a way similar to how we can see illuminants: in hearing the source (or the sounds) we hear the speaker. When speakers function well, we only hear them when we listen to the source. It it hard to listen to the loudspeaker, and we typically can only do so by listening to the source of the sound. If we listen to anything, we listen to the source. To maintain that we are undergoing an illusion is to maintain that we listen to nothing. This means that our listening fails. But it quite obviously does not fail at all. OR: Listening to those instruments was not in any way an illusory or non-veridical experience. To the contrary, the judgements based on it turned out to be spot on. And although the forensic team exercised their capacity to hear things by means of those sounds with expert precision, they did not engage in anything beyond the pale of ordinary auditory discrimination. This example brings out dramatically a philosophical point:-->

# The range of source representationalism 

How far does it go? Is the experience of hearing a piano when such an instrument is actually being played to us also one of hearing a piano representationally? From what I have shown so far this doesn't follow. When you're listening to a recording the piano need not be present in just the straightforward sense in which it must be when you're listening to it in a concert venue, without a recording. This means that, just on the basis of what we've said so far, someone might agree that hearing via recordings is representational, because here the audibility of sound sources does not depend on the presence of those sources, yet they may still emphasise that in many completely ordinary cases the sources of the sounds we hear are present in the perceptual situation. 

Now it should be clear that in ordinary hearing and in listening to a recording, the same relevant conditions are met. Although these cases are different in the end, they at least share a common factor, in the form of a sound that makes a piano audible. This implies that everything is in place for representation, also in the ordinary situation. 

But it could still be thought that, other than recordings, ordinary hearing typically also affords presentation. The point is that the ordinary case includes other conditions that also offer us presentation, and that this makes for a significant difference. The common factor may be present, but that common factor, it is thought, does not take away that hearing a piano in its presence is a fundamentally different kind of experience from hearing a piano via a recording. 

A first thing I want to say is about phenomenology. Hearing in real life can be indistinguishable from hearing via a recording. Think of those talented musicians in the bowels of London's Underground. At some distance, you may doubt whether they are actually strumming their guitar or are using a recording played covertly. In such a state of doubt, reflecting on what one hears may not be sufficient to distinguish between the two possible scenarios, because for any *original* experience of a sound actually produced by the source one hears, we can specify a conceivable, indiscriminable *recording counterpart* in which we would hear that source through a recording instead. In both scenarios we would hear the same audible qualities, and so they may to that extend have the same phenomenal character. 

There is good reason to think that for every original experience there is a recording counterpart that does not differ in phenomenal character.  Of course this is a somewhat frivolous observation, based on the mere possibility of doubting that what one hears is not a recording. But if we accept it is a possibility, we are committed to some further claims. 

Some authors assume, it seems, that if there is no difference in phenomenology, then there is no difference in representational properties. On that assumption, it seems to follow that also the original experience is representational, given that its indiscriminable recording counterpart would be. This argument is conditional on a dubious assumption. I think many will not be impressed by this argument, because of the assumption it rests on. Subjective indistinguishability is generally no adequate criterion of sameness, and there seems no good reason to suppose that in the domain of psychology it is. Why couldn't two entirely different sorts of experiences nonetheless be indistinguishable for someone who is having them? If they could, then we have as of yet no reason to think that ordinary hearing of sources is representational. 

However, even if we do not accept the argument, the possibility of such indistinguishable counterparts does bring out that if there is a difference between recording cases and real life cases, this could not be a merely phenomenological difference. For, then the indistinguishable experience, though different, would not be different, which is absurd. 

This shows the following. If you think that indistinguishable experiences have the same representational properties, you are likely to be moved by this argument, and may be led to accept the source representationalist thesis as a general claim. However, many will resist the assumption that indistinguishability is a sound guide to sameness. They will be attracted to think that, in the end, it's not about how the experience seems to us, but about how it is. If source representationalism is a general thesis about hearing sources, this must be because the metaphysics of auditory perception makes it so.

Here's the question. What do we need to assume, minimally, to be in a position to deny that even the ordinary case of hearing a piano doesn't depend on the perceptual presence of that piano? (Of course, no one will doubt that the piano needs to be present to produce those sounds, of course, in the way that it need not be present when we play back a recording.)

In the previous discussion I have assumed one condition on presence, and shown that _that_ condition is not met in the recording cases, though it is met in the ordinary cases. (This had to do with revival.) Now if we introduce a further condition on presence, namely in terms of constitutively shaping, __a popular idea__, we can say that it is met in neither the recording cases nor the ordinary cases. What is the most general/minimal version of this further condition? __The idea is that among the objects of perception some are special, and their are special because they pull the cart, so to say.__  

How do arrive at this idea? We are looking for a determinant of presence that may be met by the sound but is not met by the source. The source representationalist wants to remain neutral about our perception of sound, and only maintains that sources are represented. Moreover, the main assumption of the opponent is that the source is [or must be] present in ordinary perception. Roughly my target is the naive realist, and so I can make use of the idea that some objects constitutively determine the character of experience, just by being the way they are. To determine the character in that way just is to be present. The assumption we then need to make is that, for auditory perception, only sounds have the power to do so. From that it follows that sound sources are always heard in their absence. (Others may find it more natural to talk about which objects are represented in experience. The idea would then be that only sounds are represented perceptually. But this clearly gets us a need to distinguish 'mental' representation from perceptual representation, as I am interested in it.)

On this line, we don't need to drag along that piano, because it was never what was doing the work, perceptually, in the first place. This gives us a neat explanation of the possibility of perception-via-recording. 

Doesn't making this assumption undermine our initial case for hearing sources via their sounds? Berkeley used this line of reasoning to support the conclusion that we do not hear sound sources, strictly speaking. I think that, even if we go along with the assumption on which the reasoning relies (that only sounds can constitutively determine the character of auditory perception), we do not need to accept Berkeley's conclusion. All we should accept is that our hearing those sources is representational. The Berkeleyan cannot simply deny at this point that perceptual representation is not possible, at least not without begging the question. (Berkeley saw this, and supplies further arguments, arguments that work as long as we accept his psychology of ideas.)

# Perceptual presence

If what I have argued is right, then it means that perception---vision in particular---does not require the presence of all of its objects. If the source representationalist is right, then thinking of perception as merely a mode of awareness of what is there is too simple. Some authors have exploited the simplistic way of thinking and claimed that the very idea that perception is representational is problematic. Charles Travis writes that 

> _perception_, as such, simply places our surroundings in view, affords us awareness of them [...] It confronts us with what is there...[@travis2013aa, p. 65]
 
Undoubtedly some instances of perception simply place our surroundings in view. In particular, I think that as long as we limit ourselves to visual perception, it is extremely natural to assume that such perception consists in bringing our actual surroundings into view. To see is always to become aware of something that is present to the eye. But as soon as we take account of the possibility of perceptual representation as the source representationalist sees it, we see that perception sometimes does more. When we are confronted with a played back sound, some wholly distinct object or scene may become audible once more. This enables us to perceive something that need not actually be present there at all. So perception, as such, can do more than simply placing our surroundings in view, even if we accept that this is necessary for perception to occur.

It is perhaps telling that Travis restricts his discussion of perception to observations about vision. He does not consider other sensory modalities. In particular, Travis omits reference to those senses that for their functioning as distal senses depend on what we could call perceptual mediators, such as sounds. M.G.F. Martin writes that: “What puts vision apart from hearing, smell, and taste is that we do not conceive of the visible world as offering us primary objects of visual awareness and attention distinct from concrete objects through which we come to see the concrete” [@martin2012aa, p. 334]. It is precisely this possibility of mediation by that our advanced sound recording techniques exploit. 

The possibility of perceptual representation in auditory perception stands out in this way only because we have available to us the technology to separate our sound and source. 

It is tempting to think that precisely because of his focus on vision, Travis was bound from the outset to reach only a partial understanding of what perception, as such, can do.

<!-- (Presence does not equate with existence; it may very well be that the piano must have existed at some point in time. Presence also doesn't equate with awareness. No, as I am thinking of it, an object of perception is present only if Y, and Y isn't entailed by the play-back of a recording, while such a play-back suffices to make an object audible.) And Y = If the object is perceptible at t1, then if it were zapped out of existence at t2, making the object perceptible once more at t3 would not be possible without reintroducing the object itself again. -->
