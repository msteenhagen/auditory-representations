Source representationalism, as I will call it, is a specific view in the philosophy of perception. It is a view about what hearing sound sources consists in. What are sound sources? Some material objects or bodies produce sounds when they are played, hit, or otherwise moved. When they do so these bodies become a source of sound. It is in them and in their activity that sound originates. Take an example. On the 24th of January 24, 1975, Keith Jarrett gave a solo piano concert in Cologne. Jarrett played that night on a badly tuned Bösendorfer piano. The instrument Jarrett played on that occasion was the origin of the sounds that made up his improvised composition. That night, then, that Bösendorfer baby grand was one of the sound sources in the concert venue. 

Sources of sounds come in many kinds, of course. But a number of philosophers today writing on perception accept that at least some of the sources of sounds are themselves audible. That is, we can hear them. Not just the sound of a piano is audible, but also the piano itself (or Jarret’s playing it) is a potential audibile. I will suppose this is obvious. But how is it possible? Consider, only the sound that reaches us has the audible qualities of pitch and loudness our ears are sensitive to, not the piano itself. The source representationalist maintains that sources of sounds can become audible when they are represented in our perceptual experience. More specifically, they claim that material objects or bodies can be made audible by audible sounds in our environment, sounds produced at some point in time and now reaching our ears. According to the source representationalist, those sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception.

In this paper I show why we should accept this claim by considering an argument that supports it (§§2––6). The argument will conclude that at least some hearing is representational, in the way the source representationalist envisages. I will also consider whether the framework of perceptual representation presupposed by the source representationalist merely ranges over some of auditory perception of sound sources, or over all of it (§7). I will identify and motivate a deeper assumption about audition that may move some to take the source representationalist claim to embody a general insight about auditory perception.

# Situating the view

Before discussing the argument for source representationalism, let me situate the view in the larger debate about the nature of perception. This is helpful, as it brings out why the view should be of interest to philosophers of perception.

According to the source representationalist, perception can be representational. On the face of it, that claim seems mainstream. Yet, the specific way in which the source representationalist advances this claim is interesting for at least two reasons. First, many philosophers nowadays defend or assume the strong, categorical thesis that all perception of objects is representational. Such 'representationalists' suppose that all forms of perception are representational, all of the time. This has lead to a tacit understanding of the discussion about representation in perception: the implicit consensus is that representationalism about perception is an all or nothing affair. Either all of perception is representational, or none of it is. The source representationalist claim shows why this is a misleading way of conceiving of the situation. They commit themselves only to a weaker claim about perceptual representation, and do so coherently (as I will show below). They maintain that sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception, and so assert no more than that, potentially, there are circumstances in which perception is representational. In this way, the source representationalist thesis disrupts a tidy way of outlining the shape of the debate about the nature of perception. The logical availability of the view proves how one can coherently maintain that merely some perception is representational. This makes the position worth considering.

There is another reason why source representationalism should be of interest to those thinking about perception. The source representationalist has a story to tell about what perceptual representation is, or at least about what it could be. At this point they do not just break lines with the mainstream, but move well beyond it. For it is an often voiced objection to standard representationalism about perception that its proponents remain largely silent on what perceptual representations are. These proponents rely on the suggestion that perception is representational rather liberally, yet fail to elucidate what perceptual representation consists in (see @travis2004aa for a canonical statement of this criticism). As mentioned above, the source representationalist limits their assertion to the perceptual role of sounds. Not only does this avoid a global commitment to representations in perception, it also points to an answer to the question what perceptual representations are. Sounds are a paradigm example of such representations. The source representationalist conceives of the sounds in our environment as fulfilling a perceptual function that enables us to hear their sources. It is the sound of the piano played by Jarrett that enabled the Cologne audience to hear the instrument back in 1975. Sounds confer audibility on their sources. And the source representationalist claims that the perceptual function sounds fulfil is representational. What makes it representational? As I will spell out in more detail below, sounds represent when they make sources audible in a manner that does not depend on the presence of those sources to the perceiver. It follows from this that to perceive a sound source, a perception of its sound may be sufficient. Sounds, given the way they can function in perception, are perceptual representations, at least potentially. This is a controversial claim, no doubt. But it has the virtue of offering an informative and productive model of thinking about perceptual representation more generally. 

If the source representationalist is right, then sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception. In the next section I will present a main argument for the source representationalist claim.

# Playing back recorded sounds

To defend the source-representationalist claim that the sources of the sounds that reach our ears can be merely represented in auditory perception, I want to reflect on what we can hear when we listen to the playback of a sound recording. What is interesting about recordings is that they allow sounds that occurred on an earlier occasion to occur once more. Many people will have in their possession the album of Jarrett's performance, published as _The Köln Concert_. This album recording can be played back, which should result in the reproduction of sounds that an ECM Records engineer captured back in 1975 using a pair of condenser microphones and a portable tape machine. What does playing back this recording enable you to hear? 

Beyond question, it seems to me, is that you can hear the sound of a piano. This particular sound becomes audible as soon as it fills the room when playback starts. This sound may subtly decompose into individual sounds of piano keys pressed by Jarrett's hands. But these individual sounds are no less instances of the sound of a piano. That playing back the recording enables you to hear the sound of a piano seems perfectly obvious, but it is worthwhile to reflect on the fact.

Even though there is no piano around, that sound is genuinely there in your room. Hearing the sound of a piano by listening to a recording contrasts with a situation in which a device is used that causes us to have auditory hallucinations. If I had played the recording on such a device, you would have undergone an episode that could in some subjectively salient respects have resembled hearing Jarrett's solo improvisations. But if it did, then in other quite relevant respects it would have resembled the condition of tinnitus. Not only would there have been no actual piano, there would have be no actual sound either. As we could put it, it would at best merely seem to you that you're hearing the sound of a piano. Enjoying a piano recording by means of such an hallucination-provoking device would not involve genuinely (or 'veridically') hearing the sound of a piano. Indeed, some might say that it would not require you to hear anything at all. 

People who enjoy a recording of Jarrett's concert are typically not hallucinating. If you listen to the album, your perception not merely resembles hearing the sounds of a piano trickling into the room; hearing those sounds is exactly what's going on. Why is this relevant? Well, it brings out that in listening to a recording, there is at least one component that is completely mundane: the sound of a piano. That audible sound is a 'common factor' present both in listening to a piano in real life, and in listening to such an instrument via a recording. In the hallucination case, such common factor would be missing. The presence of this common factor motivates the idea that recordings allow sounds that occurred on an earlier occasion to occur once more. The sounds of a piano that were produced in 1974 re-occur each time we play back the recording. 

This could trigger a question. Can we speak of the sound of a piano when what is responsible for the sounds we hear is a loudspeaker? As far as I can see, the answer is either an unqualified yes, or a qualified one. They point to two ways we can understand what it is for a sound to be reproduced.  

Let me first consider the unqualified affirmation, to which I am most attracted. Some have convincingly argued that it is of the nature of sounds that they are reproducible entities (cf. @martin2012aa, the point finds confirmation in Jonathan Sterne's -@sterne2003aa history of sound reproduction and its reception). Something is reproducible only if can 'recur' in history. It counts as an abstract entity because of that. Think of a photographic image, recorded by a camera at a specific moment in history, but that allows for multiple instances to be mass-distributed in news papers and on web logs. If sounds are reproducible like that, then we may suppose that your speakers reproduce the particular sounds that were produced by a Bösendorfer piano in January 1975. If we accept this, then we can affirm without qualification that the sounds your speakers broadcast may be thought of as the sounds of a piano. Because they are reproduced individuals, sounds of a piano is what they were and still are.

On the other hand, some may want to resist attributing to sounds an inherently reproducible and to that extent abstract nature. They will think that, at least in that respect, sounds are more like people: just as it is impossible for the same person to live twice, it is impossible for a sound to sound in history twice. The sounds your speakers currently broadcast originate just there, in the corner of your room, produced by the coppery coils of your tweeters and woofers. These sounds bear no intrinsic relation to sounds that died against the walls of the opera building in Cologne in 1975, though there may be a causal relation: the sounds sound the way they do because the original sounds sounded the way they did. Unless it has lasted for over thirty-five years (for an example of such old sounds, think of the sound of the Niagara Falls), a sound heard in 1975 and a sound heard in 2014 must be ontologically distinct, or so the thought runs. In light of our actual recording practices, I do not think this rather unimaginative view has much to recommend to it. But even on such an austere conception of the metaphysics of sound, a well-calibrated stereo set can broadcast sounds exactly like the sounds that Jarrett's off-key piano produced in 1975. This is just the auditory analogue of the possibility that someone gives birth to a _Doppelganger_ of, say, Napoleon. They would give birth not the same individual, but to someone who on many occasions can pass itself off for it. Once this is accepted, then it should be granted that playing back a recording may at least allow you to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original, recorded sounds. This is an idealization, of course. But it's crucial to see that if we assume that sounds are not inherently reproducible, this ideal must be regarded as somehow regulative in the practice of sound recording: to play a recording is to produce sounds that, ideally, have all the relevant audible characteristic in common with the sounds that were recorded. And so even in this qualified sense, what your speakers broadcast may be thought of as sounds of a piano: they are sounds that have the typical audible characteristics of sounds pianos produce.

This provides us with a preliminary characterisation of the situation. What matters is that in listening to a recording of Jarrett's piano concert you find yourself in a very similar auditory situation as the original audience back in 1975. Your stereo-set allows you to recreate an auditory environment, if not by reintroducing the very sounds produced on that Cologne concert stage, then at least by surrounding you with sounds that have the relevant audible characteristics in common with those original sounds.
