Source representationalism, as I will call it, is a specific view in the philosophy of perception. It is a view about what hearing sound sources consists in. What are sound sources? Some material objects or bodies produce sounds when they are played, hit, or otherwise moved. When they do so these bodies become a source of sound. It is in them and in their activity that sound originates. Take an example. On the 24th of January 24, 1975, Keith Jarrett gave a solo piano concert in Cologne. Jarrett played that night on a badly tuned Bösendorfer piano. The instrument Jarrett played on that occasion was the origin of the sounds that made up his improvised composition. That night, then, that Bösendorfer baby grand was one of the sound sources in the concert venue. 

Sources of sounds come in many kinds, of course. But a number of philosophers today writing on perception accept that at least some of the sources of sounds are themselves audible. That is, we can hear them. Not just the sound of a piano is audible, but also the piano itself (or Jarret’s playing it) is a potential audibile. I will suppose this is obvious. But how is it possible? Consider, only the sound that reaches us has the audible qualities of pitch and loudness our ears are sensitive to, not the piano itself. The source representationalist maintains that sources of sounds can become audible when they are represented in our perceptual experience. More specifically, they claim that material objects or bodies can be made audible by audible sounds in our environment, sounds produced at some point in time and now reaching our ears. According to the source representationalist, those sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception.

In this paper I show why we should accept this claim by considering an argument that supports it (§§2––6). The argument will conclude that at least some hearing is representational, in the way the source representationalist envisages. I will also consider whether the framework of perceptual representation presupposed by the source representationalist merely ranges over some of auditory perception of sound sources, or over all of it (§7). I will identify and motivate a deeper assumption about audition that may move some to take the source representationalist claim to embody a general insight about auditory perception.

# Situating the view

Before discussing the argument for source representationalism, let me situate the view in the larger debate about the nature of perception. This is helpful, as it brings out why the view should be of interest to philosophers of perception.

According to the source representationalist, perception can be representational. On the face of it, that claim seems mainstream. Yet, the specific way in which the source representationalist advances this claim is interesting for at least two reasons. First, many philosophers nowadays defend or assume the strong, categorical thesis that all perception of objects is representational. Such 'representationalists' suppose that all forms of perception are representational, all of the time. This has lead to a tacit understanding of the discussion about representation in perception: the implicit consensus is that representationalism about perception is an all or nothing affair. Either all of perception is representational, or none of it is. The source representationalist claim shows why this is a misleading way of conceiving of the situation. They commit themselves only to a weaker claim about perceptual representation, and do so coherently (as I will show below). They maintain that sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception, and so assert no more than that, potentially, there are circumstances in which perception is representational. In this way, the source representationalist thesis disrupts a tidy way of outlining the shape of the debate about the nature of perception. The logical availability of the view proves how one can coherently maintain that merely some perception is representational. This makes the position worth considering.

There is another reason why source representationalism should be of interest to those thinking about perception. The source representationalist has a story to tell about what perceptual representation is, or at least about what it could be. At this point they do not just break lines with the mainstream, but move well beyond it. For it is an often voiced objection to standard representationalism about perception that its proponents remain largely silent on what perceptual representations are. These proponents rely on the suggestion that perception is representational rather liberally, yet fail to elucidate what perceptual representation consists in (see @travis2004aa for a canonical statement of this criticism). As mentioned above, the source representationalist limits their assertion to the perceptual role of sounds. Not only does this avoid a global commitment to representations in perception, it also points to an answer to the question what perceptual representations are. Sounds are a paradigm example of such representations. The source representationalist conceives of the sounds in our environment as fulfilling a perceptual function that enables us to hear their sources. It is the sound of the piano played by Jarrett that enabled the Cologne audience to hear the instrument back in 1975. Sounds confer audibility on their sources. And the source representationalist claims that the perceptual function sounds fulfil is representational. What makes it representational? As I will spell out in more detail below, sounds represent when they make sources audible in a manner that does not depend on the presence of those sources to the perceiver. It follows from this that to perceive a sound source, a perception of its sound may be sufficient. Sounds, given the way they can function in perception, are perceptual representations, at least potentially. This is a controversial claim, no doubt. But it has the virtue of offering an informative and productive model of thinking about perceptual representation more generally. 

If the source representationalist is right, then sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception. In the next section I will present a main argument for the source representationalist claim.
