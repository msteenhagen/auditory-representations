Source representationalism, as I'll call it, is the view that the sources of the sounds we hear are represented in perception, whenever they are heard. Source representationalists may accept that, when we hear a Volkswagen, our auditory awareness consists in a perceptual relation to a sound; the sound of a Volkswagen is present in experience. Yet they deny that hearing a Volkswagen consists in an auditory presentation of that car itself. Source representationalists maintain that sound sources, such as cars, are only represented in auditory perception. In this paper I show why we should accept their claim.

##### §1.
There is a famous stereo recording of Keith Jarrett's *The Köln Concert*, a piano improvisation performed on the 24th of January 1975 in Cologne. Its actual audience was seated in the celebrated opera house designed by Wilhelm Riphahn. But, thirty-nine years later, we are now here in Cambridge. We're in a college auditorium equipped, fortunately, with a good enough sound system. This puts us in a position to play back a fragment of Jarrett's celebrated improvisations. What can we hear if we do so?

##### §2.
First of all, you can hear the sound of a piano. This particular sound becomes audible as soon as it fills the room when playback starts. This sound may subtly decompose into individual sounds of piano keys played by skilled hands. Let's assume of all these sounds that they are instances of the sound of a piano.

Your perception just now stands in stark contrast with a situation in which a device is used that causes us to have auditory hallucinations. If I had played the recording on such a device, you would have undergone an episode that in some subjectively salient respects would have resembled hearing Jarrett's solo improvisations. But in other respects it would have resembled the condition of tinnitus. What matters is that enjoying a piano recording by means of such a device would not involve hearing the sound of a piano---strictly, it would not require you to hear anything at all.  

You weren't hallucinating just now. Your perception not merely resembled hearing sounds of a piano trickling into the room; it was such a hearing. The hearing of those sounds was necessary for undergoing that experience. When one listens to a recording, one may have a veridical perception of sounds whose audible characteristics at least in part determine what it is like to have such experience.

This could trigger a question. What is meant by saying that we could hear the sound of a piano? Can one genuinely hear the sound of a piano when none is actually played? Some argue that it is of the nature of sounds that they are reproducible [@martin2012aa]. If that is right, then these speakers could indeed reproduce the particular sounds that were produced by a Bösendorfer piano in January 1975.

Some may want to resist attributing to sounds an inherently reproducible and abstract nature. But even they can agree that, given a well-calibrated stereo set, a playback can bring forth sounds exactly like the sounds Jarrett's piano produced. Playing back a recording may allow you to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original, recorded sounds.

##### §3.
In general, we can hear more than sounds alone. J.O. Urmson writes,

> Clearly one may see, hear, feel, smell, and taste physical objects like motor cars and apples; it requires ingenious stage setting to make 'I hear an apple' or 'I taste a motor car' sound natural ... but one may certainly hear a motor car or taste an apple [@urmson1968aa, p. 117].

I think Urmson is right. Just as we can see a magpie, or taste vinegar in our salad, we can hear things such as people in the corridor, aeroplanes overhead, and a pub fight down the street. We can hear their sounds as well, of course. But there is no good reason to adopt the restrictive view, advanced by Berkeley's mouthpiece Philonous in the _Three Dialogues_, that sounds are all we hear [@berkeley1954aa].

Notice that although it certainly is one, this observation crucially is not merely a report of common sense; it has a compelling basis in the phenomenology of audition as well. Sounds and sources can be distinct objects of attention, and on occasions may even compete for it. Recently, a number of authors have argued that our ability to attend to things that are not sounds reveals that among the possible objects of audition are more things than sounds alone [See: @ocallaghan2009aa].

Imagine that at night you hear a sound coming from your living room. Reluctant to get out of bed, you first listen more carefully to what goes on. You realise that it's the cat who again managed to open the kitchen door. You don't pay much heed to the exact sounds you hear. No doubt you could set yourself to attend to them, but you have better things to do: tracking a feline threat to designer furniture. Attentively you listen to the cat; you may listen to it scratching the sofa, or, if you're unlucky, hear it throwing over a vase (and, inevitably, you'll hear the vase breaking).

We can attend to sounds, but often we can also attend to, and hence listen to, what a sound is of [cf. @gaver1993aa]. Not only are we happy to characterise the experience described above as one of ‘hearing a cat’, but moreover, the fact that we can distinguish between the different acts of attending that each would involve---attending to the animal, attending to its scratching noises---proves that we can hear more than sounds alone.

<!-- This means significantly more than that we are able to hear *that* a sound is of a cat, or *that* the cat is in the room. Such epistemic hearing of facts about sounds or pets does of course occur, but the point is different: listening attentively both to a sound and to a cat is only possible if both sound and cat can be heard. Just like Urmson's motor car, your cat, as the source of a sound you hear, can be an object of audition. -->

If this is right, then interesting things follow. For by the same reasoning, we may conclude that in listening to a recording we can hear a sound's source. Real-life examples clearly support this point. To find out what had happened in the Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh in September 1994, a team of audio forensic investigators played back the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved after the accident. The team was particularly interested in a malfunctioning of the plane's rudders. Hence, it is unlikely that they listened merely to the sounds reproduced by their playback equipment. Indeed, they found out that the rudder's eventual jamming was not due to mechanical obstruction, but occurred because of inept operation of controls. Such a finding was only possible because the investigators were able to listen attentively to two sources audible in the recording: the plane's rudder and the crew's manipulation of switches and dials on the dashboard. 

This suggests that also in listening to a recording it is possible to turn one's attention to a sound's source, and hear it. Whether one can engage in this mode of attentive listening to sources depends on whether one hears the right sounds, not on whether it is a recording or not. 
However, someone could object that the case of hearing a cat at night and hearing the recording of a plane's rudder are different. Where in the former case there actually is a cat producing those sounds, in the latter a loudspeaker is directly responsible for the audible sound. Hence, the objection would run, the fact that one can attend to something beyond the mere sound of a recording just suggests that we can hear the loudspeaker that reproduces it.

This objection is unconvincing. As every audiophile will attest, loudspeakers are inaudible if they function well. Imagine that, while listening to the recording of Jarrett's play, an annoying tearing noise makes itself heard. Your loudspeaker is bust, and its sound now interferes with the piano's melodies; such a tearing will stand out in experience as not belonging to the recording itself. This is what hearing a loudspeaker is like. Understanding what it would be to hear a loudspeaker requires consideration of cases where the device has a noticeable defect. It should be clear that, instead of setting a standard for listening to recorded sounds, hearing a speaker just signals that your equipment needs to be replaced.

##### §4.
It is now possible to give a straightforward answer to the question what one can hear if one plays a recording of Jarrett's improvisations. If such a recording is of good enough quality, then one is in a position to hear not only sounds that may have every audible characteristic in common with the original sounds of Jarrett's performance, but also a Bösendorfer piano---the source of those sounds.

##### §5.
The following is a sufficient condition for perceptual representation:

> **Perceptual representation** If a perceiver perceives some object that is not present to the senses, then the object is represented in perception.

This condition allows us to identify typical occurrences of perceptual representation. In particular, it allows us to say that if we merely play back a recording of a piano, then any hearing of a piano counts as an instance of perceptual representation. This is because we would hear the instrument while it is not present to the senses. And this in turn suggests that hearing a sound with the right characteristics suffices for being able to hear a piano representationally.

Assuming that there is nothing peculiar about pianos, we may now accept a restricted version of source representationalism. Whenever we hear a source while merely playing back a sound recording, the source is represented in experience, because we hear it while it is not present to the senses.

This raises a question. By what mechanism is perceptual representation of this kind possible? Merely suggesting that we possess a capacity for representational perception may not be entirely satisfactory. Yet, we can say more. The heard sound plays a determining role in the exercise of this capacity [this is standardly overlooked, see e.g. @tolliver2007aa, p. 143]. 

Just as other perceptual capacities, the capacity for representational perception is only exercised in response to something---it is a *reactive* capacity [cf.@kalderon2014aa]. Sound figures as an essential cog in the machinery of representation in auditory perception. This is because, in general, what we can hear is at least in part determined by the audible character of the sounds we perceive. And if the sound reproduced by these speakers did not have audible characteristics of the right kind, then hearing that sound would not enable us to hear a piano at all. We heard a piano because we heard sounds with the right characteristics. 

This suggests that it is the heard sound that represents a piano to us. Naturally, this leads us to ask what it is about that sound, as an object of audition, that lets it take on such a representative attire. Here I will not address this question.  If the previous discussion is along the right lines, then whatever account we give of the characteristics of sounds, or of perceptual representations more generally, we do possess a psychological capacity to make use of them. Hearing sounds with the right character puts one in a position to exercise this capacity. 

In what remains I will show that this understanding of auditory representation has the result that source representationalism should be accepted as a global thesis about auditory perception.

##### Mike's point

In a discussion of this material, Mike suggested that the argument I now use will not convince an opponent. This is because, ultimately, it is abductive. He suggested a different strategy: focus on the fact that we don't think of our perception of the piano when we listen to a recording as illusory. 

We take ourselves to hear a piano, we take ourselves to be listening to one, and yet we do not take it that any piano is present to us. If this is an argument for representation, then we must assume that a non-representational experience is one where, if we take ourself to experience an x, then we take an x to be present to us. Illusions, on this model, are non-representational experiences. 

Perhaps I can proceed through a discussion of features that reveal 'more'. So, an object can have an appearance such that it looks to have a back-side. One doesn't see the back, but one sees the whole object when one looks at it head-on. There is an analogous temporal case. But these are not the cases I need: for, I need a case where the features do make something 'not strictly perceived', perceived.

Ultimately, I want to suggest that the problem of images finds a parallel in the 'problem of sounds'. We agree that a sound appears to sense, but does this also allow a coach to appear to sense? I want to defend an Augustinian account of perception, where we must understand that a perceptual activity is responsible for the object of perception: but this activity is constrained by what is present to us. (If it is not constrained in this way, we're merely imagining: in such a case, the activity is productive.) And I should keep in mind that, ultimately, it is the principle of mediation that is doing the lifting: we must think of the specific way the mediator appears to sense as being sufficient for the mediated appearing to sense – that is the discussion of the concept of 'design'. Here I in fact have a stronger case for the visual representations I focus on. 

He also emphasises that we can hear the source relation, and we agreed that one can have a further disagreement whether the source relation is an intentional one. 

##### §6.
The previous discussion brought out that we can hear both the sound of a piano and a piano itself in listening to a recording of Jarrett's *Köln Concert*. One may reason that in such circumstances, although the sound may be present in auditory experience, the piano we hear is represented in peception. Our hearing a Bösendorfer piano could not consist it a perceptual relation, given such an instrument's absence from the perceptual situation.  Hearing sounds with the typical audible characteristics of the sound of a Bösendorfer piano enabled you to hear such an instrument in its absence. But now a question remains: Is the experience of hearing a piano when such an instrument is actually being played to us also one of hearing a piano representationally?

Think of those talented musicians in the bowels of London's Underground. At some distance, you may doubt whether they are actually strumming their guitar or are using a recording played covertly. In such a state of doubt, reflecting on what one hears may not be sufficient to distinguish between the two possible scenarios, because for any *original* experience of a sound actually produced by the source one hears, we can specify a conceivable, indiscriminable *recording-counterpart* in which we would hear that source through a recording instead. In both scenarios we would hear the same audible qualities, and so they may to that extend have the same phenomenal character. 

Of any original auditory experience and its recording-counterpart we may ask: Do they differ in phenomenal character? If they do not differ, then we may conclude that if a piano is represented in the recording-counterpart experience, then a piano is equally represented whenever we hear such an instrument if it is actually being played to us. This is because two experiences with the same phenomenal character will be experiences with the same representational properties.

There is good reason to think that for every original experience there is a recording-counterpart that does not differ in phenomenal character. Notice, however, that this is not because these experiences would be subjectively indistinguishable; subjective indistinguishability is generally no adequate criterion of sameness. Instead, the reason is to be found in the structural role that the audible characteristics of sounds play in determining the phenomenal character of our hearing sound sources.

The vital point is that we can only hear a sound source if we hear the right audible characteristics of a sound. Whenever we hear a piano, we do so because we become aware of specific audible qualities of sounds that reach our ears. We can hear a piano because these qualities are of the right kind. In many cases, what it is for us to hear a specific quality or characteristic of sound depends on what it is for us to hear a source of some kind. For instance, what it is to hear typical characteristics of the sound of an aeroplane rudder depends on what it is to hear parts, properties and materials of such a device itself. In other words, being perceptually aware of those specific characteristics of a sound *just is* what it is to hear a rudder. This is confirmed by the fact that when we are asked to describe such audible qualities of sounds, we are typically bound to describe the material sources and material properties they allow us to hear [@nudds2010aa, p. 284; @gaver1993aa, p. 19].

I this is right, then in both original and recording-counterpart experience a sufficient condition for hearing a source is met. It is not just that in both cases we would hear a sound that has identical characteristics; in both cases we would hear the same characteristics. The crucial distinction here is that between hearing a sound *tout court* and hearing a sound by hearing some specific characteristics of it. If hearing some of these audible characteristics suffices for hearing a source, then we hear a source in both perceptual situations in the same way. 

So, is hearing a piano when such an instrument is actually being played to us a representational perception? Yes it is. If hearing a Bösendorfer piano consists in hearing the specific audible characteristics of the sound of a Bösendorfer, then such a perception does not depend on whether the sounds we hear are currently being produced by a piano, or are due to a playback of a recording of a piano. This is because playing back a recording can put us in a position to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original sounds. One could say that our experience in hearing the recording already exemplifies what it is to hear a sound source. If we hear a source when we listen to a recording counterpart, then the heard source is represented in perception. We're aware of the same qualities when we hear a piano that is actually being played to us. Therefore, also this experience will be one of hearing a piano representationally.

##### §7.
Source representationalism is the view according to which the sources of the sounds we hear---cats, pianos, aeroplanes---are, whenever we hear them, represented in experience. Source representationalists may accept that, when we hear a piano being played, our auditory experience consists in a perceptual relation---an auditory presentation of the sound of a piano. But the analysis of listening to things through recordings, and the established conceivable sameness of phenomenal character of hearing recorded sounds and of hearing sounds that are actually produced, demonstrates the correctness of the source representationalist claim. Whenever we hear a piano or some other sound source, all sound sources we hear are represented in auditory experience.

The correctness of the source representationalist claim has broader significance. It brings to our attention that sounds are an indispensable structural element in the workings of perceptual representation in the auditory modality. Sounds are objects of perception that fulfil a valuable representational function in hearing. This outlines a broader programme. It suggests that a complete picture of the scope of perceptual experience must give an account of whether, and if so, how, in perceptual modalities other than audition representations figure in our perception of the world.
