abstract: Source representationalism is the thesis that the sources of the sounds we hear, whenever they are heard, are represented in experience. Starting from arguments about listening to recordings, I develop a defence of this thesis. I show that listening to recordings enables us to hear sound sources representationally. I then argue that, given the structure and character of auditory perception, hearing a source when it is actually producing sounds is equally representational. This establishes source representationalism as a global thesis about auditory perception. This has important implications for our understanding of perceptual representation more generally.
...

Source representationalists make a claim about auditory perception. They maintain that the sources of the sounds we hear are represented in perceptual experience, whenever they are heard. Source representationalists may accept that, when we hear a piano being played, our auditory experience consists in an auditory presentation of the sound of a piano. Yet they deny that hearing a piano can consist in an auditory presentation of that piano itself. In this paper I show why we should accept this claim.

{>>Some say that perceptual states are representations. Others say they are not representations: they are relations to token objects. This conference aims to explore various ways in which the two sides of the debate could be reconciled.

##### §1.
You listen to a stereo recording of Keith Jarrett's *The Köln Concert*, a piano improvisation performed on the 24th of January 1975 in Cologne. Its actual audience was seated in a celebrated opera house designed by Wilhelm Riphahn. You, however, are in London, in an almost empty, quiet study. It's 2014. Your only company is the fauteuil you sit in, and a high fidelity stereo set. The quality of the recording and the calibration of the loudspeakers are superb. You press play, well aware that you're in for a treat. Leaning back, eyes closed, what can you hear?

##### §2.
First of all, you can hear the sound of a piano. This particular sound becomes perceptible as soon as it fills the room when playback starts. Closely attending to Jarrett's performance, the sound may subtly decompose into individual sounds of piano keys played by skilled hands. Let's assume of all these audible sounds that they are instances of the sound of a piano.

We may contrast this experience with one in which a device is used that causes us to have auditory hallucinations. Playing back a recording on such a device would result in undergoing an experience that in some subjectively salient respects resembles hearing Jarrett's solo improvisations, while in others it resembles tinnitus. But enjoying a piano recording by means of such a device would however not involve hearing the sound of a piano.  

Listening to an ordinary playback of the album release of Jarrett's *Köln Concert* is no hallucination. Your experience not merely resembles hearing sounds of a piano trickling into the room; it is such a hearing. It is a  veridical perception of playful sounds whose perceived characteristics make up the phenomenal character of your auditory experience.

This could trigger a question. What is meant by saying that in your empty study you can hear the sound of a piano? Can you genuinely hear the sound of a piano in the absence of any such instrument? Some argue that it is of the nature of sounds that they are reproducible [@martin2012aa]. If they are right, then your speakers could reproduce the particular sounds that were produced by a Bösendorfer piano in January 1975.

Some may want to resist attributing to sounds an inherently reproducible and abstract nature. However, even they could agree that, given a well-calibrated stereo set, a playback can comprise sounds qualitatively identical to, and hence indistinguishable from, the sounds Jarrett's piano produced. Playing back a recording may allow you to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original, recorded sounds.

##### §3.
In general, we can hear more than sounds alone. J.O. Urmson writes,

> Clearly one may see, hear, feel, smell, and taste physical objects like motor cars and apples; it requires ingenious stage setting to make 'I hear an apple' or 'I taste a motor car' sound natural ... but one may certainly hear a motor car or taste an apple [@urmson1968aa, p. 117].

Just as we can see a magpie, or taste vinegar in our salad, we can hear things such as people in the corridor, aeroplanes overhead, and a pub fight down the street. We can hear their sounds as well. But there is no good reason to adopt the restrictive view, advanced by Berkeley's mouthpiece Philonous, that sounds are all we hear [@berkeley1954aa].

This observation is not merely a report of common sense; it has a compelling basis in the phenomenology of audition as well. Sounds and sources can be distinct objects of attention, and on occasions may even compete for it. Recently, a number of authors have argued that our ability to attend to things that are not sounds reveals that the objects of audition include more than sounds alone [See: @ocallaghan2009aa].

Imagine that at night you hear a sound coming from your living room. Reluctant to get out of bed, you first listen more carefully to what goes on. You realise that it's the cat who managed to open the kitchen door again. You don't pay much heed to the sounds you hear. No doubt you could set yourself to attend to them, but you have better things to do: tracking a feline threat to designer furniture. Attentively you listen to the cat; you may listen to it scratching the sofa, or, if you're unlucky, hear it throwing over a vase (and, inevitably, hear the vase breaking).

We can attend to sounds, but we can often also attend to, and hence listen to, what a sound is of. Against Berkeley, not only are we happy to characterise the experience described above as one of ‘hearing a cat’, but moreover, the fact that we can distinguish between the different acts of attending proves that we can hear more than sounds alone.

This means significantly more than that we are able to hear *that* a sound is of a cat, or *that* the cat is in the room. Such epistemic hearing of facts about sounds or pets does of course occur, but the point is different: listening attentively both to a sound and to a cat is only possible if both sound and cat can be heard. Just as Urmson's motor car, your cat, as the source of a sound you hear, can be an object of audition.

If this is right, then by the same reasoning we may conclude that in listening to a recording we can hear a sound's source. Consider an example. To find out what had happened in the Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh in September 1994, a team of audio forensic investigators played back the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved after the accident. The team was particularly interested in a malfunctioning of the plane's rudders. Hence, it is unlikely that they listened merely to the sounds reproduced by their playback equipment. Indeed, they found out that the rudder's eventual jamming was not due to mechanical obstruction, but because of inept operation of controls. Such a finding was only possible by listening attentively to two sources audible in the recording: the plane's rudder and the crew's manipulation of switches and dials on the dashboard. 

This suggests that also in listening to a recording it is possible to turn one's attention to a sound's source, and hear it. Whether one can engage in this mode of attentive listening to sources depends on whether one hears the right sounds, not on whether it is a recording. 

However, someone could object that the case of hearing a cat at night and hearing the recording of a plane's engine are different. Where in the former case there actually is a cat producing those sounds, in the latter a loudspeaker is directly responsible for the audible sound. Hence, the objection would run, the fact that one can attend to something beyond the mere sound of a recording suggests just that we can hear the loudspeaker that reproduces it.

This objection is unconvincing. As every audiophile will attest, loudspeakers are inaudible if they function well. Imagine that, while listening to the recording of Jarrett's play, an annoying tearing noise makes itself heard. Your loudspeaker is bust, and its sound now interferes with the piano's melodies; such a tearing will stand out in experience as not belonging to the recording itself. This is what hearing a loudspeaker is like. Understanding what it would be to hear a loudspeaker requires consideration of cases where the device has a noticeable defect. It should be clear that, instead of setting a standard for listening to recorded sounds, such an experience just signals that equipment needs to be replaced.

##### §4.
We wondered what one could hear when one plays a recording of Jarrett's improvisations. We may now answer that one can hear not only sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original sounds of Jarrett's performance, but also a Bösendorfer piano---the source of those sounds.

##### §5.
The following is a sufficient condition for perceptual representation:

> **Perceptual representation** If a perceiver perceives some object that is not present to the senses, then the object is represented in perception.

This condition allows us to identify typical occurrences of perceptual representation. In particular, it allows us to say that if we merely play back a recording of a piano, then any hearing of a piano counts as an instance of perceptual representation. This is because we would hear the instrument while it is not present to the senses. And this in turn suggests that hearing a sound with the right characteristics suffices for being able to hear a piano representationally.

Assuming that there is nothing peculiar about pianos, we may now accept a restricted version of source representationalism. Whenever we hear a source while merely playing back a sound recording, the source is represented in experience, because we hear it while it is not present to the senses.

This raises a question. By what mechanism is perceptual representation of this kind possible? Merely suggesting we possess a capacity for representational perception may not be entirely satisfactory. Yet, we can say more. The heard sound plays a determining role in the exercise of this capacity. 

Just as other perceptual capacities, the capacity for perceptual representation is only exercised in response to something---it is a *reactive* capacity [cf.@kalderon2014aa]. Sound figures as an essential cog in the machinery of representation in auditory perception. This is because, in general, what we can hear is at least in part determined by the audible character of the sounds we perceive. And if the sound reproduced by our stereo set did not have audible characteristics of the right kind, hearing that sound would not enable us to hear a piano at all. We hear a piano because we hear a sound with the right characteristics. 

This suggests that it is the heard sound that represents a piano to us. Naturally, this leads us to ask what it is about that sound, as an auditory object, that lets it take on such a representative attire. Here I will not address this question. Whatever account we give of the characteristics of sounds, or of perceptual representations more generally, if the previous discussion is along the right lines, we do possess a psychological capacity to make use of them. Hearing sounds with the right character puts one in a position to exercise this capacity. 

In what follows I show that this understanding of auditory representation implies that source representationalism should be accepted as a stronger, global thesis about auditory perception.

##### §6.
We observed that we can hear both the sound of a piano and a piano itself in listening to a recording of Jarrett's *Köln Concert*. We reasoned that in such circumstances, although the sound may be present to the mind, the piano we hear is represented in auditory experience. Hearing sounds with the audible characteristics of the sound of a Bösendorfer piano enabled us to hear such an instrument in its absence. Now, is the experience of hearing a piano when such an instrument is actually being played to us also one of hearing a piano representationally?

Think of those talented musicians in the bowels of London's Underground. At some distance, one may be in doubt whether they are actually strumming their guitar or are relying on a covertly playing recording. In such a state of doubt, reflecting on what one hears may not be sufficient to distinguish between the two possible scenarios, because for any *original* experience of a sound actually produced by the source one hears, there is a conceivable, indiscriminable *recording-counterpart* in which we hear that source through a recording instead. Both auditory experiences may very well have the same phenomenal character. 

Hence, and more generally, of any original auditory experience and its recording-counterpart we may ask: Do they differ in phenomenal character? If they do not differ, then we may conclude that if a piano is represented in the recording-counterpart experience (which is true, it turns out), then a piano is equally represented when we hear such an instrument when it is actually being played to us. This is because two experiences with the same phenomenal character will be experiences with the same representational properties.

There is good reason to think that for every original experience there is a recording-counterpart that does not differ in phenomenal character. This is not because they are subjectively indistinguishable; subjective indistinguishability is generally no adequate criterion of sameness. Instead, the reason is to be found in the structural role the audible characteristics of sounds play in determining the phenomenal character of our hearing of sound sources.

As we saw, we can only hear a sound source if we hear a sound with the right characteristics. When we hear a piano we do so because we experience the specific audible characteristics of sounds that reach our ears. In most cases, what it is for us to hear those characteristics depends on what it is for us to hear a source of some kind. What it is to hear a sound with the characteristics of the sound of an airplane rudder, for instance, depends on what it is to hear parts, properties and materials of such a rudder itself. In other words, hearing those specific characteristics just is what it is to hear a rudder. This is confirmed by the fact that when we are asked to describe such audible characteristics of sound, we are typically bound to describing the sources and their properties they allow us to hear [@nudds2010aa, p. 284].

I this is right, then it suggests that in both original and recording-counterpart experience a sufficient condition for hearing a source would be met. It is not just that in both cases we would hear a sound that has identical characteristics; in both cases we would hear the same characteristics. If hearing some of these characteristics suffices for hearing a source, then we hear a source in both situations in the same way. 

Can we say more about these characteristics? We can do this by considering what it is to be a perceptible characteristic, and contrast perceptible characteristics with perceptible qualities. Think about a visible individual. It has visible qualities. These are colour and form. But it will also have visible characteristics that can only be specified by reference to the item it is a characteristic of. A wax tomato may have the visible characteristics of a genuine tomato, and this does not imply that those are the visible characteristics of a wax tomato all of the sudden. There is a concept of typicality that allows us to say that certain perceptual appearances are proprietary to some class of objects. So, if we say of some object that it looks like a tomato, we may only be able to say that it has a tomato like sheen, or whatever: refer to tomatoes in our explication. 

Martin wants to identify ways of looking with what he calls observational properties. So, "observational properties are those properties for which necessarily no object which exemplifies them, and is characteristic with respect to look for that property, has a visual duplicate"[@martin2010aa]. Let us apply this to sound. Those properties for which necessarily no sound which exemplifies them, and is characteristic with respect to sound for that property, has an audible duplicate that lacks the property. So if the property of being the sound of an F is the property of allowing one to hear an F, then if a sound sounds like the sound of an F it is the sound of an F. Being the sound of an F is not primarily a causal concept: it is a concept that indicates proprietaries. It may be that something is the sound of an F, but is so in a way that doesn't immediately stand out. One may need to know more before one is able to appreciate it. In that case, it is not a characteristic sound of an F; but it does have the characteristics of a sound of an F. 

{>>What this suggests is that the is a property of sounds we can label the property of 'being a sound of...'. In the relevant sense, perhaps not all sounds have that property. And a sound can instantiate multiple properties of this kind. They are, it should be noted, similar to representational properties in the case of talking about imagery. An image may have the property of being an image of an F. We can ask: is it a visible property? Some will say yes, others will say no. Being an image of an F does not suggest a specific appearance on the part of the image. It suggests that the image fulfils a function. But we must suppose that we recognise something as fulfilling that function on the basis of its appearance [?]. Or on the basis of what? <<}

Perhaps I should look into work on timbre: perhaps timbre properties are properties of sounds that fit the pattern I am looking for? 


So is the experience of hearing a piano when such an instrument is actually being played to us one of hearing a piano representationally? Yes it is. If hearing a Bösendorfer piano consists in hearing the specific audible characteristics of the sound of a Bösendorfer, then having that experience does not depend on whether we hear sounds actually produced by such a piano or a recording of them. This is because playing back a recording may allow us to hear sounds that have every audible characteristic in common with the original sounds. This implies that our experience in hearing the recording exemplifies what it is to hear a sound source. If we hear a source when we listen to a recording, then the heard source is represented in experience. The same experience occurs when we hear a piano that is actually being played to us. Therefore, also this experience will be one of hearing a piano representationally.

##### §7.
Source representationalism is the view according to which the sources of the sounds we hear—cats, pianos, aeroplanes—are, whenever we hear them, represented in experience. The analysis of listening to things through recordings, and the established conceivable sameness of phenomenal character of hearing recorded sounds and hearing sounds that are actually produced, demonstrates the correctness of the source representationalist claim. Whenever we hear a piano or some other sound source, this object of audition is represented in experience.


The correctness of the source representationalist claim has broader significance. The observation that sounds are an indispensable element in the workings of perceptual representation in the auditory modality—that they are the objects of perception that fulfil a representational function—suggests a broader programme. It indicates that a complete picture of the scope of perceptual experience must consider how, in more perceptual modalities, representations figure in our perception of the world.
