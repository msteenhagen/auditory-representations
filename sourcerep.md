Source representationalism, as I will call it, is a specific view in the philosophy of perception. It is a view about what hearing sound sources consists in. What are sound sources? Some material objects or bodies produce sounds when they are played, hit, or otherwise moved. When they do so these bodies become a source of sound. It is in them and in their activity that sound originates. Take an example. On the 24th of January 24, 1975, Keith Jarrett gave a solo piano concert in Cologne. Jarrett played that night on a badly tuned Bösendorfer piano. The instrument Jarrett played on that occasion was the origin of the sounds that made up his improvised composition. That night, then, that Bösendorfer baby grand was one of the sound sources in the concert venue. 

Sources of sounds come in many kinds, of course. But a number of philosophers today writing on perception accept that at least some of the sources of sounds are themselves audible. That is, we can hear them. Not just the sound of a piano is audible, but also the piano itself (or Jarret’s playing it) is a potential audibile. I will suppose this is obvious. But how is it possible? Consider, only the sound that reaches us has the audible qualities of pitch and loudness our ears are sensitive to, not the piano itself. The source representationalist maintains that sources of sounds can become audible when they are represented in our perceptual experience. More specifically, they claim that material objects or bodies can be made audible by audible sounds in our environment, sounds produced at some point in time and now reaching our ears. According to the source representationalist, those sounds can represent material objects or bodies in perception.

In this paper I show why we should accept this claim by considering an argument that supports it (§§2––6). The argument will conclude that at least some hearing is representational, in the way the source representationalist envisages. I will also consider whether the framework of perceptual representation presupposed by the source representationalist merely ranges over some of auditory perception of sound sources, or over all of it (§7). I will identify and motivate a deeper assumption about audition that may move some to take the source representationalist claim to embody a general insight about auditory perception.
