Short paper on auditory representations

#### Abstract
Source representationalism is the thesis that the sources of the sounds we hear, whenever they are heard, are represented in experience. Source representationalists may accept that auditory experience consists in a relation to particular sounds. What they deny is that hearing a sound source consists in a perceptual relation to such a source. Starting from arguments about listening to recordings, I develop a defence of the source representationalist's thesis. I show that listening to recordings enables us to hear sound sources representationally. I then demonstrate that, given the structure and character of auditory perception, hearing a source when it is actually producing the sounds one hears is equally representational. This establishes source representationalism as a global thesis about auditory perception. This conclusion has important implications for our understanding of perceptual representation more generally.
